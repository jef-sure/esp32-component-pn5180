## v 0.0.7 - 2026-03-17

### Fix ISO14443-3A anticollision resolver

Rewrote `pn5180_14443_anticollision_level()` and removed
`pn5180_14443_resolve_collision()` to improve the bit-level
anticollision loop, verified against the NXP NfcRdLib v07.14.00 reference
implementation.

## v 0.0.9 - 2026-03-22

### Fix RF ON command

- Correct bit check: rfStatus & RF_STATUS_TX_RF_STATUS_MASK instead of rfStatus & 0x01
- Removed polling loop: FIELD_ON (0x16) is synchronous — when the SPI command completes (BUSY low), the result is final. No need to busy-wait on IRQs/register. Just one pn5180_readRegister after the command.
- RFCA error detection: If RF field doesn't come up, checks RF_ACTIVE_ERROR_IRQ_STAT to distinguish "external RF field blocked us" from a generic failure.
